# SamplingStrata 1.5-5

Implemented a new Rcpp version, much more performant, of the functions

- *buildStrataDF*, to increase the efficiency of the “atomic” and
  “continuous” methods
- *buildStrataDFSpatial*, to increase the efficiency of the “spatial”
  method in OptimStrata

Deleted function *prepareSuggestion*

# SamplingStrata 1.5-4

- Minor changes due to the introduction of R 4.3.0

# SamplingStrata 1.5-3

## Major changes

- As in R 4.2.0 a matrix objects now also inherit from class “array”,
  this invalidates code incorrectly assuming that class(matrix_obj)) has
  length one. So, changes have been done consequently in SamplingStrata
  functions where tests on class of an object were performed, otherwise
  causing errors.

# SamplingStrata 1.5-2

## Major changes

- A new function *selectSampleSpatial* has been added: if geographical
  coordinates are available in the frame, in order to obtain spatially
  distributed selected points this function makes use of the lpm2_kdtree
  function from the SamplingBigData package (Tillé-Grafstrom).

- A new function *bethelProc* has been added: this function allows to
  execute a complete procedure from the Bethel optimal allocation to the
  selection of a sample, without having to optimize the strata, that are
  supposed to be given and fixed.

# SamplingStrata 1.5-1

## Major changes

- As starting from R 4.0.0 ‘stringsAsFactors = FALSE’ becomes a default,
  in all calls to data.frame the parameter ‘stringAsFactors = TRUE’ has
  been indicated, in order to ensure the same results

- Fixed some bugs related to handling take-all strata for ‘atomic’ and
  ‘spatial’ methods

# SamplingStrata 1.5

## Major changes

- A new *optimStrata* function is available: this function is a wrapper
  that allows to execute the three different optimization functions: (i)
  optimizeStrata (method = *atomic*); (ii) optimizeStrata (method =
  *continuous*); (iii) optimizeStrata (method = *spatial*).

- A new *optimizeStrataSpatial* function is available: this function
  optimizes the frame stratification taking into account also spatial
  correlation of frame units in a territorial context. As for
  *optimizeStrata2*, this function can be used only on continuous
  stratification variables.

- A new *kMeansSolutionSpatial* function has been added: this function
  is the same than *KmeansSolution*, but operates in the case of
  optimization with only continuous stratification variables and has to
  be used only in conjunction with *optimizeStrataSpatial*.

- A new *KmeansSolution2* function has been added: this function is the
  same than *KmeansSolution*, but operates in the case of optimization
  with only continuous stratification variables and has to be used only
  in conjunction with *optimizeStrata2*.

- A new *prepareSuggestion* function has been added: this function
  operates on the result of *kMeanSolution2* or *kMeanSolutionSpatial*
  order to prepare the suggestions for the optimization with only
  continuous stratification variables.

- A new *computeGamma* function has been added: this function allows to
  calculate a heteroscedasticity index, to be passed to optimization
  step as a *model* parameter in order to correctly evaluate the
  variance in the strata.

# SamplingStrata 1.4-1

## Major changes

- A new *summaryStrata* function has been added, enabling to get
  structured information regarding the strata produced by the
  *optimizeStrata2* function (operating on only continuous
  stratification variables).

- A new *assignStrataLabel* function has been added, enabling to assign
  the optimized strata label to new units to be added in the sampling
  frame.

- Fixed a bug in the optimization step for continuous variables

# SamplingStrata 1.4

## Major changes

- A new function *optimizeStrata2* is available. This function performs
  the same task than *optimizeStrata*, but with a different Genetic
  Algorithm, operating on real values genome, instead of an integer one.
  This pemits to operate directly on the boundaries of the strata,
  instead of aggregating the initial atomic strata. In some situations
  (limited size of sampling frame) this new function is much more
  efficient. The limitation is in the nature of the stratification
  variables, that are required to be all continuous (though categorical
  ordinal could be handled).

- A new function *expected_CV* has been added to calculate CVs on target
  variables in different domains that may be expected from a given
  solution, output of the *optimizeStrata* execution.

- Fixed a bug in the optimization step when considering also take-all
  strata

# SamplingStrata 1.3

## New functions

- The optimization of population frame is run in parallel if different
  domains are considered. To this end, the parameter *parallel* can be
  set to TRUE in the *optimizeStrata* function. If not specified, n-1 of
  total available cores are used OR if number of domains \< (n-1) cores,
  then number of cores equal to number of domains are used.

- A new function *KmeansSolution* produces an initial solution using the
  kmeans algorithm by clustering atomic strata considering the values of
  the means of target variables in them. Also, if the parameter
  *nstrata* is not indicated, the optimal number of clusters is
  determined inside each domain, and the overall solution is obtained by
  concatenating optimal clusters obtained in domains. By indicating this
  solution as a suggestion to the optimization step, this may greatly
  speed the convergence to the optimal solution.

- A new function *selectSampleSystematic* has been added. It allows to
  select a stratified sample with the systematic method, that is a
  selection that begins selecting the first unit by an initial randomly
  chosen starting point, and proceeding in selecting other units by
  adding an interval that is the inverse of the sampling rate in the
  stratum. This selection method can be useful if associated to a
  particular ordering of the selection frame, where the ordering
  variable(s) can be considered as additional stratum variable(s).

- It is now possible to handle *anticipated variance* by introducing a
  model linking a proxy variable whose values are available for all
  units in the sampling frame, with the target variable whose values are
  not available. In this implementation only linear model can be chosen.
  When calling the *buildStrataDF* function, a dataframe is given,
  containing three parameters (beta, sigma2 and gamma) for each couple
  target / proxy. On the basis of these parameters, means and standard
  deviations in sampling strata are calculated accordingly to given
  formulas.

# SamplingStrata 1.2

## Major changes

- The crossover function in the genetic algorithm has been modified by
  considering the *grouping* version of this algorithm: instead of
  mixing chromosomes in an indifferentiate way, groups of them in one
  parent (representing already aggregated strata) are attributed to the
  other parent when generating a child, preserving their composition.
  Moreover, parents are selected with a probability proportional to
  their fitness (in the previous version selection was completely at
  random). In many cases this can greatly speed the convergence to an
  optimal solution.

- A new function *adjustSize* has been added. It allows to adjust the
  sample size and related allocation in strata on the basis of an
  externally indicated overall sample size. The adjustment of the sample
  size is perfomed by increasing or decreasing it proportionally in each
  optimized stratum.

- A new function *buildFrameDF* has been added. It allows to create a
  *sampling frame* dataframe by indicating the dataset in which the
  information on all the units are contained, the identifier, the X
  variables, the Y variable and the variable that indicates the domains
  of interest.

- In function *optimizeStrata* now the *initialStrata* parameter is a
  vector, whose length is equal to the number of strata in the different
  domains.

- All outputs are written to an .subdirectory.

# SamplingStrata 1.1

## Major changes

- Function *memoise* from the same package (now required) is applied
  before each evaluation in order to save processing time. This may
  largely increase the efficiency of the algorithm.

- A *recode* function is applied on every generated solution in order to
  recode a genotype of n genes with k\<=n distinct alleles 1, 2, …, k in
  such a way that the distinct alleles of the recoded genotype appear in
  the natural order 1, 2, …, k. This avoids to consider as distinct two
  solutions that are equivalent but make use of a different coding.

# SamplingStrata 1.0-4

## Bug fix for old releases

# SamplingStrata 1.0-3

## New functions and changes

- Modified the output to the console or to the file of results: of all
  the solutions, only the optimal value for each generation is
  visualised.

- Now the visualisation of the trend in the optimal and mean values is
  optional: the plot can be avoided by setting showPlot = FALSE when
  calling optimizeStrata. It can be advisable when the number of
  iterations is very high.

# SamplingStrata 1.0-2

## Bug fix for old releases.

# SamplingStrata 1.0-1

## Major changes

- The object returned by function *optimizeStrata* is no more a
  dataframe but a list: (i) the first element of the list is the
  solution vector
  (solution$indices); (ii) the second element of the list is the dataframe containing aggregated strata (solution$aggr_strata).

- In all the functions that previously produced .csv files and .pdf
  plots in the working directory, as a default this is no more the
  current behaviour. To write these files, it is now necessary to set
  the *writeFiles* flag to TRUE.

# SamplingStrata 1.0

## Major changes

- Two new functions: (i) *evalSolution*, to evaluate the found solution
  in terms of expected target variables precision and bias obtainable by
  samples drawn from the otpimized frame; (ii) *tuneParameters*, to
  determine the best combination of values to assign to the parameters
  necessary for the execution of the genetic algorithm used for the
  optimization of the frame stratification.
